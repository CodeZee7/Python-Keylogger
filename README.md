## General Information
- This is a simple keylogger.
- It solves many problems in cybersecurity and is used by various organisations.
- The purpose of a keylogger is to identify and log/keep track of, the keys that the user presses
- I decided to complete this project while i was researching and learning about cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I plan to do a tutorial on this if I haven't already!


## Technologies Used
- This program uses key logging technologies such as keyboard listeners to listen to which keys the user presses.


## Features
- When the script is run, it starts listening to the keys pressed while the device is being used
- The keys are then formatted and a text file is created if it does not exist.
- The keys are stored in the log.txt file to be accessed after.


## Setup
A requirement of this project is the pynput module. Run the following pip command in CMD.

    pip install pynput


## Usage
To use the program, you do not need to create the txt file as it will automatically be created. You run the python script and the keylogger will have started. Once the user presses esc, the program will running and you can locate log.txt in the same directory as the python file.


## Project Status
Project is: complete, but may have future amendments in order to improve the project.
